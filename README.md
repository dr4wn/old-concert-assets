# old-concert-assets

### Do not open a pull request or an issue! I will close it.
### Here are a lot of the files that I've come up with during my time at certain "virtual" concert experience groups.

## Reasoning

I personally have no use for these files / scripts anymore, and they were mine to begin with, so I have no issue putting it out for people to use. There are some files such as the *Anti Collision / Camera Lock* that has been around for months or years, please do not antagonize me on those, as those are scripts that were grabbed from already public sources (or just not writte by me), also it is recommended you update the anti collision as the method provided in this repository is deprecated.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer 
**A lot of this code is outdated. I would not write this today.**

*Just as a disclaimer,* although a lot of these filse are _"ready"_ for use, it's recommended that you figure out a way to rework these files in a modern fashion. I have newer versions that were used for a concert experience group that is now defunct, and I can personally say that you are better off refurbishing this one to your own likings and/or correcting some optimization / API calls within some handlers.

## Usage

[set-one](./batches/set-one/) contains files from events and [set-two](./batches/set-two/) is a compilation of files that I will be updating as I find.

To view the source code, click [here](./batches/set-one/src/). *(links redirect to the first set of uploads)*

To download the code in **.rbxm** format and have a copy to use in your game, click [here](./batches/set-one/files/).


All I really ask for is credits towards this repository, it's not like I'm going to go and chase you down for them, but this repository is not meant to be gatekept. Modules such as the lanyard are things I've seen certain users attempt and fail, I hope this can be provided as a learning tool and something to enhance your events.
